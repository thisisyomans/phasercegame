/*TODO: If you plan to fully build out this game using node for server, use this file as your
"index.js" or "app.js" file (whatever you like to name it). If you don't plan to build a fully
deployable game, or don't plan on deploying it, just use the "node-http-server" package to test
on localhost.*/
